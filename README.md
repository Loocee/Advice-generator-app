## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- jQuery


### What I learned

I learned to use the fetch method to get data from an API. I also learned about the q tag. I worked on my box shadow property skill.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch#supplying_request_options) - This helped me in understanding how to fetch data from API. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - To understand how the box shadow property works. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
